  <h2>📌 High-Frequency Trading: Ethical Concerns</h2>
  <p>This essay explores how modern financial technologies like high-frequency trading can raise serious ethical concerns for fairness, transparency, and public trust in markets.</p>

      <p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> Whether you are a young college student who just began contributing to their retirement account or a 72-year-old who has been investing his whole life, you probably have been negatively affected by the efforts of Wall Street insiders squeezing ordinary people for their own financial gain. Financial institutions like investment banks and hedge funds have been known to engage in malpractice leading to market manipulation. One of the most impactful examples of blatant deceit and fraud was the 2008 financial crisis where banks and credit rating agencies hid risks from investors. The disastrous aftermath that followed included U.S. households losing over $16 trillion in net worth, the value of the stock market being cut in half, and thousands of jobs lost (Gratton, 2024). Global crises like the 2008 crash expose the deeply troubling ethical failures of financial giants and show how they have the ability to destabilize economies and harm millions of lives. Nowadays, the biggest players in finance are employing a more modern approach of breaching ethical guidelines for monetary gain through a strategy called high-frequency trading (HFT).</p>

    <p>High-frequency trading is a subset of quantitative finance, requiring in‑depth math, statistics, and programming knowledge to predict financial markets. In short, HFT is the method of computerized buying and selling of assets in high volumes for small profits through lightning-fast connections to financial exchanges. Originally an unpopular strategy in the stock market, HFT quickly grew in the early 2000s into the dominating force it is today. In U.S. equity markets like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for example, HFT makes up more than 50% of trading volume (Gerig, 2013). At first glance, high-speed trading seems like a brilliant technological innovation, but a closer look at its impact on those left behind reveals ethical questions.</p>
    <p>Chicago Booth’s Eric Budish estimated that HFT firms typically earn $5 billion a year in net profits by capitalizing on advantages over other stock market participants (Maiello, 2021). The best way to illustrate this issue is by comparing it to a race where some cars are allowed to start seconds earlier than others, giving them an unfair advantage regardless of skill level. Similarly, HFT firms gain a head start by being both physically close to exchanges and making smarter trades based on the speed at which they receive data. Another comparison is with the invention of the calculator. After the calculator’s creation, any complex math problem could be solved in an instant whereas for people without calculators, the same problem would take hours or days. Unlike calculators, however, HFT is only available to certain investment firms, restricting regular individuals from reaping its financial benefits.</p>
    <p>This disadvantage was especially evident in a recent case where a major stock exchange provided undisclosed advantages to select high-speed trading firms. In 2024, the U.S.-based telecommunications group McKay Brothers filed a complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accusing Nasdaq—the second-largest U.S. stock exchange—of secretly offering hollow-core fiber optic cables, which carry trading data quicker than standard counterparts, to select firms for $10,000 per month (Steer, 2025). By curating an unfair environment, Nasdaq chose a utilitarian approach that sacrificed traders’ trust to maximize shareholder benefit. Such events can reduce trading activity, weakening the economy. When major companies lose value due to reduced demand, jobs, goods, and services across the economy suffer (Liberto, 2023).</p>
    <p>In response, Nasdaq issued a public statement: “In close consultation with the regulator and our clients, Nasdaq has begun discontinuing the [high-speed trading] service.” Furthermore, the exchange launched an “Equalization Project” to ensure a level playing field for all customers using high-speed technology (Carter, 2025). While this restores equality for large firms, the retail investor still faces inherent disadvantages.</p>
    <p>Another prominent example occurred in South Korea. Citadel Securities—a top hedge fund—utilized HFT in the South Korean market between 2017 and 2018, profiting roughly $10 billion in 2024 (Arroyo & Doherty, 2025). Retail trading made up 60% of trades in that market (Lee, 2023). Citadel’s speed advantage let it buy securities microseconds before others, then resell at higher prices, akin to a farmer’s market scenario where a quick buyer profits off less-informed participants. This distortion involved 1,422 stocks daily, totaling over $300 million in profits. In 2022, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission fined Citadel Securities $9.6 million for this manipulation (Rahman, 2023).</p>
    <p>From past crises, we see ethical dimensions to financial collapses. Firms with vast resources and talent have used HFT to manipulate markets. While algorithmic trading revolutionized securities, its benefits remain limited to large institutions. Regulatory responses—such as exchange “speed bumps” delaying orders (Zoican, 2019)—aim to protect retail investors and stabilize markets. Continued oversight is needed to ensure fairness and prevent recessions.</p>

  <h2>🛡️ Data Ethics: The Bangladesh Data Leak</h2>
  <p>This piece analyzes the 2023 Bangladeshi government data leak through the lens of professional ethics in data science.</p>

      <p><strong>Excerpt:</strong> Imagine a game of soccer, only this game is special because it doesn’t have any rules. Players could play the game however they want to with the only objective of getting the ball in the opposing team’s goal. What would happen under these circumstances? The short answer is, there would be no order. If there were no limitations as to how players could score a goal, there would be dangerous consequences...</p>

    <p>On June 27, 2023, Viktor Markopoulos, a cybersecurity consultant affiliated with Bit Crack Cyber Security, discovered a vulnerable Bangladeshi government website (Antoniuk, 2023). While searching Google for programming help, he unintentionally uncovered a massive data leak exposing full names, addresses, phone numbers, and national ID numbers of over 50 million citizens. By modifying the API endpoint—similar to changing an item on a restaurant menu—he accessed records unprotected by authentication (Raywood, 2023).</p>
    <p>Markopoulos promptly alerted the Bangladesh e-Government Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT). TechCrunch verified the leak by comparing public datasets, confirming the data’s authenticity (TBS, 2023). The CIRT conducted an exhaustive investigation, examining misuse signs on dark web forums. However, months later, in October, fragments of the data began circulating on Telegram (The Daily Star, 2024). A citizen’s national ID can be exploited for passport fraud, land transactions, and bank account openings (Dhanuka, 2023).</p>
    <p>This incident spurred legislative action. In September 2023, Bangladesh passed the Cyber Security Act (CSA), building on the Digital Security Act (DSA) of 2018. Critics like Amnesty International warned that the CSA retained provisions threatening freedom of expression and privacy (Amnesty, 2023). The breach violated Rule 5 of the Data Science Code of Professional Conduct—data scientists must protect confidential information and prevent unauthorized disclosure (Data Science Association, 2025).</p>
    <p>For individuals, cybersecurity best practices include keeping software updated, avoiding public Wi‑Fi for sensitive transactions, and reporting cybercrimes to IC3 (FBI, 2025). This event reminds us that ethics—our digital age’s true firewall—is critical in safeguarding society.</p>
